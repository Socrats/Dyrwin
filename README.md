# Dyrwin
## Simulator for Evolutionary Game Theory problems

The intention of this repository is twofold:
- Reproduce results from top-tier papers that use EGT to solve different kinds of problems;
- and to provide a c++ framework to perform evolutionary analysis of game theoretical scenarios.

## Requirements
Requires C++ compiler with c++11 support

## Installation
Compile with make

## Execution
To get help on how to run the simulation execute:
````bash
./dyrwin --help
````

If you want your results to to be stored in an output file, you need to provide a file path

You can also run the simulation through a python configuration file like the ones provided in ./examples:
